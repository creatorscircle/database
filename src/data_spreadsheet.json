Working with Penn faculty, you will experiment with different techniques and design tools and use the city of Philadelphia's historic and modern architecture for inspiration. Offered by the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, the summer architecture program for high school students prepares you for college admissions as you experience college life and create your portfolio. The courses are similar to those offered by the University of Pennsylvania Architecture Program, but are sequenced and paced for the age and experience of high school students.",

Since then, the competition has seen the best of interdisciplinary intellectual inquiry and has worked to promote independent research among the brightest young minds.\n \n  MIT INSPIRE is also unique in that it has been wholly student-run for the entirety of its existence. MIT takes pride in encouraging its students to be independent and innovative problem-solvers. Because our students are kept very busy with the rigors of their academic curriculum alone, however, an extracurricular project such as this can and did become overwhelming. Nonetheless, we wish to honor our students’ original commitment to MIT INSPIRE 2018 by evaluating all submissions and recognizing the exceptional ones.",
